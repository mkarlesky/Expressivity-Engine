ExpressYourself is a command line server app that uses ExpressivityEngine to generate an expressivity vector from a Kinect skeleton stream and sends it over a network connection.

Visualization is a Processing sketch client app that draws two 3D spheres from expressivity vectors of two independent Kinect setups (small cubes represent origin points). In this configuration it is assumed two people are facing each other. See .png files.
